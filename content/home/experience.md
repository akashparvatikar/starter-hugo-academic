        * Investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of inter- and intra-class diagnostic variability in histopathology images and spatial intratumoral heterogeneity in multiplex image data
        * Develop computational pathology tools for the challenging task of correctly classifying sub-categories present within the diagnostic spectrum of breast lesions
        * Conceptualize an explainable AI framework intended to capture the visual diagnostic thinking of the pathologists
        * Build a computational pathology-based cognitive assistant by demonstrating perceptual and planning components which are useful in bringing the above technologies to everyday pathology practice
